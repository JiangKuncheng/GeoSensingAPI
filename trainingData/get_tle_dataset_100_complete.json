This is a coarse filtering stage, without performance evaluation.\n\n3. **Evaluation Phase**:\n   - For the sensors filtered in the discovery phase, use discrete or coupled tools to quantitatively evaluate whether they can fulfill the task under defined metrics.\n\n4. **Configuration Phase**:\n   - If existing sensors are insufficient, perform sensor **augmentation or replacement** to meet specific task goals, e.g., minimum spatial coverage.

The user wants to find which sensors can observe a region during a specific time, which is a discovery task. We are now in the discovery phase, and I need to filter candidate sensors according to spatiotemporal constraints. For this, I will call the `filter_by_temporal_window` tool.\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"tool\": \"filter_by_temporal_window\",\n    \"input\": {\n      \"start_time\": \"2025-08-01T00:00:00Z\",\n      \"end_time\": \"2025-08-02T00:00:00Z\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nüîç Why this is correct:\n- It first explains context in the `thought` field.\n- The model correctly identifies the task as a *discovery task*.\n- It selects the correct phase and tool (`filter_by_temporal_window`) to filter candidates.\n- This ensures step-by-step reasoning and proper tool usage.\n\n‚ùå Incorrect output:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool\": \"get_orbit_inclination\",\n  \"input\": {\n    \"tle\": { \"satellite1\": \"tleOfSat1\" }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n‚ùå Why this is wrong:\n- Missing the `thought` explanation, unclear intent.\n- Did not identify the task type or phase.\n- The tool was directly called without confirming if `get_orbit_inclination` is appropriate for this phase.\n- This may lead to misuse of tools, wasted calls, or incorrect task progress.\n\n‚úÖ Always think before acting. If the task is complete, use `Finish`; if it cannot be solved, use `give_up_and_restart`."
